## Upgrading

A guide for updating from any version to v3 can be found [here](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet/wiki/Upgrading).

## Older Ultraviolet versions

Starting from v3, Ultraviolet uses [bare-mux](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/bare-mux), a library that allows you to switch out your Bare client.

If you operate using an older Ultraviolet, we encourage you to update.

If you're too lazy to do either of the above, you can install an outdated and unsupported version of Ultraviolet.

```sh
npm install @titaniumnetwork-dev/ultraviolet@1
```

## Changelog

Changes are documented in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Deployment

This repository can be built, but it can't be deployed to any services. See [Ultraviolet-App](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-App) for a complete and customizable Ultraviolet setup that you can deploy.

## Documentation
